# WorkWithDatabase

##Short Description
Create a Console application which is able to read data from csv file and write it to the database

##Topics
Designing types
Asynchronous computing

##Requirements
Code style
Create data access level using Repository pattern. The goal of this task is not to dig into details of working with database but to understand how asynchronous code works. So there is no need to use Entity Framework or any other ORM to implement this task. You can use any Sql/NoSql database and any library/framework which doesnâ€™t require a lot of effort to be set up. You can use RavenDb or any other database.
Each method invocation of Repository<T> should be logged using Logging Proxy
Use csv enumerable developed at task Csv Enumerable
